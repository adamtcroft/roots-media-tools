Overall concept:
You are building a suite of tools that will eventually be run completely 
autonomously to develop video and audio content for a church.  Said church does 
a live stream once a week on YouTube, and it would be helpful for that content 
to be downloaded, edited into shorter form pieces, and re-uploaded.  You are 
going to build this piece at a time.

Project: Get Media
Your first project will be simply about aquiring the appropriate media and 
downloading it effectively

Project: Preparing Media to Edit
Once we have the media to effectively edit, we'll build a process and a rule set 
for you to cut one long video into smaller chunks - a sermon, shorts from the 
    sermon, and songs.  We'll probably end up also pulling audio only of each of 
    the songs at some point.  But, before actually doing the editing work, we'll 
    need to establish what you need and how to actually go about doing the 
    editing.

Project: Editing all the Media
Once we have the other two projects finished, we'll go about editing the media

Project: Uploading the Media
Once we've got a system in place and a consistent result for editing the media, 
we'll figure out where to upload and move the data to.
