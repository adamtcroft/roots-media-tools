1. Install yt-dlp (`sudo pacman -S yt-dlp`) and run `lua scripts/download_latest_live.lua` 
   to verify the download script works. (.gitignore already updated, script already created)
2. Review the video previously downloaded, and concept 1-2 ways you could 
   consistently find the sermon content from the video and edit that into its 
   own separate video.  Write your concepts in Communication.md for me to 
   review.
