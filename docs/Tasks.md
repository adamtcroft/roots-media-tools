1. remove every1. Per the last message in communications, modify 
   download_latest_live.lua.  Make sure you pull captions from the video.  You 
   don't need to pull anything BUT the video and captions.  Notice that in the 
   video, before the sermon, there is subdued music and/or a prayer.  After the 
   sermon, there is also a prayer and transition into music.  The sermon comes 
   in the middle of the video roughly.  With this information, would you modify 
   download_latest_live.lua to download only what we need, then run it to 
   actually download latest, then see if you can find a start and stop timestamp 
   for the sermon and share that in Communication.md
