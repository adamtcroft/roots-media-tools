1. Based on your information for sermon start and end time in communication.md - 
   it seems like you would make an incredibly successful edit.  If possible, 
   develop scripts in .sh or .lua to determine the start and end times.  Develop 
   a third script which will save a new video of just the sermon itself, based 
   on the start and end times.  Test each script for output.  You should be able 
   to use the timing scripts to feed into the edit script and output a video of 
   just the sermon.
