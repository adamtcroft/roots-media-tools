1. Review the YouTube account at 
   https://www.youtube.com/@rootscommunitychurch2868/ we will want to be pulling 
   video from the "Live" video section.  See if you can download the most recent 
   live video.  Edit the .gitignore so you don't push that video to git.
2. Delete any videos you've downloaded to this repository.  Create a script that 
   will download the most recent "Live" video from 
   https://youtube.com/@rootscommunitychurch2868/
3. Review the video previously downloaded, and concept 1-2 ways you could 
   consistently find the sermon content from the video and edit that into its 
   own separate video.  Write your concepts in Communication.md for me to 
   review.
